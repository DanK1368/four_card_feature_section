### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

In this challenges I practiced using CSS Grid more to position the 4 components based on the design given for mobile and desktop version.
Using the grid-template-areas I realized how easy it is to position the components later on during the media queries by just adjusting the gird-template-area layout.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on my mobile first approach before optimizing the layout of the components for bigger screen sizes.
My goal is to become more efficient in styling with CSS/SASS und using CSS Grid/flexbox more effectively.
